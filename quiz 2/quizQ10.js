// Write a program to count the number of vowels in a given string.

// Will need to tell the computer which letters are vowels
// How to count the number of ocurences instead of just returning the vowels themselves

var string = "Krista";

var vowels = ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u", "y"];

console.log("There are" + vowelNumbers + "in" + string);
