// 2. Write a program to rotate the string 'javascript' by periodically removing one letter from the end of the string and attaching it to the front.

// Will need to create a for loop to iterate through the string
// May need to seperate the letters of the string into individual characters then move,
// the first letter and join them together each time the for loop iterates
// Possibly need to use end index to grab the last letter and maybe prepend to attatch it to the begining?
//still trying to find a way to do this without using substring
