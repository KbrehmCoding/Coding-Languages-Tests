// Write a program to replace every character in a given string with the character following it in the alphabet.

// probably need to create a loop that splits all the letters into seperate array items
// maybe need to use the code for the alphapet to change the letters, like maybe i++ to the code that then returns the letter after it
// then string join once the loop has gone through all the letters
