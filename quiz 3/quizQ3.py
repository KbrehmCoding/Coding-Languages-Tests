#  3. Write a program to calculate multiplication and division of two numbers (input from user). Think two input boxes and two buttons.

# TODO look up pyhon code to take user input in  the command line and use it in math functions
num1 = input("Please input first number")
num2 = input("Please input second number")
operator = input("Would you like to multiply(M) these numbers, or divide(D) them?")

    (multiply) =>
        num1 = (num1).val()
        num2 = (num2).val()
        multiply = num1 * num2
        sumMulti = num1 + " Multiplied by " + num2 + " is " + multiply
        print(sumMulti)
    )
    (divide) =>
        num1 = (num1).val()
        num2 = (num2).val()
        divide = num1 / num2
        sumDivi = num1 + " Divided by " + num2 + " is " + divide
        print(sumDivi)
    )
